# Vanilla-Inspired Teleporters

Vanilla-Inspired Teleporters adds a teleporter block that fits seamlessly into the Vanilla Minecraft playing experience. Only one new block is created, which is the teleporter itself. Stand on the teleporter, and teleport with ease!

Teleporters exist on circular networks; each teleporter links to the next teleporter on the network, and the last teleporter links to the first one. Players define networks by inserting a key into the teleporter by right clicking it, which can be a block, an item, or no key at all. Teleporter networks are defined by their key - teleporters may only teleport to other teleporters with the same key.

Ender Teleporters behave exactly the same as their regular counterparts. Unlike regular teleporters, however, ender teleporters can also teleport between dimensions, whereas regular teleporters cannot.

Players can also block or lock teleporters. Blocking is achieved by placing a non-passable block either one or two spaces above the teleporter. When a teleporter is blocked, no player can enter or exit, and other teleporters on the network will skip the blocked teleporter. Locking is achieved by supplying redstone power to the teleporter. When a teleporter is locked, players may enter through the teleporter but not exit, and other teleporters on the network will skip the locked teleporter.
